### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h3>I'm a student.</h3>
</br>
<h3>I love playing game.</h3>
<h4>Snake..</br>
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?</br>
Every night, I can feel my leg and my arm.. even my fingers.. the body I've lost.</br>
The comrades I've lost..</br>
Won't stop hurting.</br>
It's like they are still there.</br>
You feel it too, don't you?</br>
...</br>

Boss,</br>
I'm gonna make'em give back to our past.</br>
Take back everything we've lost.</br>
And I won't rest.. until we do.</h4>
